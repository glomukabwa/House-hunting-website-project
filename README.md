- Created and implemented the website landing page which includes a **search and filtering functionality** for looking for available houses.
- Created and implemented the **admin dashboard** for managing listings, approving/rejecting caretaker accounts, and monitoring system activity
- Conducting debugging and testing to ensure a smooth user experience.
